In addition to being an economist,
I am a Roman Catholic priest and a member of the
[US Central and Southern Province](https://www.jesuitscentralsouthern.org/)
of the [Society of Jesus](https://www.jesuits.global/), 
an international religious order also known as the Jesuits.

I decided to study economics in order to use my undergraduate degrees in 
[mathematics](https://math.ou.edu/) and 
[computer science](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs) from the 
[University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu),
in order to understand
more deeply the reasons why many Mexicans and other Latin Americans 
migrate to the United States. In my second year in the Jesuits, I worked in the 
[Casa de los Pobres](https://casadelospobresusa.com/), a Franciscan soup kitchen in Tijuana, Mexico
in spring 2007. The experience on the border left a deep
impact on me. 

From 2015-18, during my theology studies, I completed concurrently
a [Master's in International and Development Economics](https://myusf.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/economics/idec) at the 
[University of San Francisco](http://www.usfca.edu) and
a [Master's in Divinity](https://www.scu.edu/jst/academics/academic-degrees/master-of-divinity-mdiv/)
at the [Jesuit School of Theology](https://www.scu.edu/jst/).
I did fieldwork in Chiapas, Mexico with [Capeltic](https://www.capeltic.org/home),
a coffee cooperative sponsored by the [Mexican Jesuits](https://jesuitasmexico.org/).

As a newly ordained priest, I worked four blocks from the US/Mexico border at
[Sacred Heart Catholic Church](https://www.sacredheartelpaso.org/) from 2018-2020.
This second experience on the border confirmed my desire to study
economics in order to come up with better public policy, both in 
sending communities like those in Chiapas and receiving communities like in El Paso.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the 
[Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the
[University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu). I continue to visit El Paso
and Chiapas on a regular basis.
