Storer\nDecember 3, 2024.\nR&R at Agricultural Economics.\n\nAbstract\nWith the rise of market-led development, marketing cooperatives have emerged that offer smallholder producers a guaranteed minimum price for their cash crops. Their existence is threatened when members side-sell a part of their harvest to outside buyers. We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with indigenous coffee producers in southern Mexico to examine the effect of four factors in the marketing decision: additional income, the presence of microcredit and/or technical assistance, average outside buyer price, and harvest quantity. Our results show that participants allocate on average 82% of their harvest to the certain-price buyer. Changes in harvest quantity and outside-buyer price have minimal effects. The offer of complementary services has a null effect. Moreover, 21% of the participants always allocate their entire harvest to the certain-price buyer. Extra income increases this probability by 11%. Subgroup analysis reveals that this effect is limited to existing cooperative members.\nDraft: December 3, 2024"

Boyd, Jesse Anttila-Hughes\nUnder review.\n\nAbstract\nSmallholder coffee producers face a combination of pre- and post-harvest risk factors that leaves them particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. A popular form of on-farm diversification is honey production through beekeeping, that has both nutritional and commercial value. This study investigates the role of honey production as means of food security management due to the heightened pollinating activity during the coffee flowering stage that follows the annual coffee harvest provides an additional non-contemporaneous source of income. Using primary data collected in coffee-producing regions of Chiapas, Mexico, I find that during the honey harvest months, which occurs during the early stage of the lean season, beekeeping coffee producers are less exposed to food insecurity over coffee producers who don’t diversify into honey.\nDraft: July 18, 2024"

    "text": "Where You Go Depends on Who You Know: Social Networks as Determinants of Mexican Internal Migration\nStephen Pitts\n6 Sep 2022\n\nAbstract\nRecent qualitative evidence suggests that social networks play an important role in potential migrants’ decisions to migrate and their choice of destination. Yet even the latest literature employing microeconomics migration models with social networks often only estimates these models on small household panel data sets. In this paper, I use the Mexican population census to estimate a structural gravity model with social networks on internal migration flows from origin municipalities to destination states over three recent five-year periods at the intensive and extensive margin. To proxy for the social networks, I use internal migrant flows along the same corridor in a previous time period. My results show that social networks affect migration flows. At the extensive margin, a 1% increase in the size of the social network increases by 5%, 12%, and 13% the likelihood of a migration corridor; at the intensive margin, the equivalent social network elasticities are 19%, 30%, and 32%. I identify the effects using origin and destination characteristics as well as the presence of a migrant flow in 1960 to control for other factors that could drive migration along these corridors. These results contribute to both microeconomic and macroeconomic analysis of the determinants of migration.\nDraft: Sep 2022"

We begin by discussing the Latin American context: the role of agricultural production in the economy of Latin American countries and the particular place of smallholder producers viz-a-viz industrial agricultural producers. The Fair Trade (FT) and cooperative movements have deep roots in this region, thus we present a brief overview of the FT history. Finally, we describe how producer organizations respond to the present-day challenges of agricultural producers by functioning as “connective organizations” and offer a case study of a coffee cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico.\nElgar Online Publishing"

Recently, groups of producers have formed coffee cooperatives that attempt to regain market power by integrating the other steps of the value chain. This study uses matching to estimate the effect of membership in one such cooperative on the household economy of indigenous coffee producers in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. It contributes to the literature by considering new determinants of participation and outcomes of interest. First, social capital at the individual and village level is correlated with cooperative membership more than other demographic factors. Second, cooperative members report an increase in the share of coffee sold and income from coffee sales but not in per-kilo price or total income. These two results reflect particular features of the Chiapas reality and the desires of the indigenous people the cooperative serves. Thus, they reiterate the importance for economic development projects to consider the context of their interventions.\nThe chapter is a revised version of my master’s thesis, which is published open access.\nEmerald Publishing | USF thesis repository"
