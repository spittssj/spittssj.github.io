    "section": "",
    "text": "In addition to being an economist, I am a Roman Catholic priest and a member of the US Central and Southern Province of the Society of Jesus, an international religious order also known as the Jesuits.\nI decided to study economics in order to use my undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science from the University of Oklahoma, in order to understand more deeply the reasons why many Mexicans and other Latin Americans migrate to the United States. In my second year in the Jesuits, I worked in the Casa de los Pobres, a Franciscan soup kitchen in Tijuana, Mexico in spring 2007. The experience on the border left a deep impact on me.\nFrom 2015-18, during my theology studies, I completed concurrently a Master’s in International and Development Economics at the University of San Francisco. I did fieldwork in Chiapas, Mexico with Capeltic, a coffee cooperative sponsored by the Mexican Jesuits.\nAs a newly ordained priest, I worked four blocks from the US/Mexico border at Sacred Heart Catholic Church from 2018-2020. This second experience on the border confirmed my desire to study economics in order to come up with better public policy, both in sending communities like those in Chiapas and receiving communities like in El Paso."
