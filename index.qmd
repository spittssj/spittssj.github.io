# Welcome

Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in the 
[Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the
[University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu). My advisor is
[Marc Bellemare](http://marcfbellemare.com/). 

Beginning in Fall 2025, I will be the Wade Jesuit Visiting Assistant
Professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.marquette.edu/business/economics/)
of [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu). 

One area of [my research](research.html) examines smallholder 
producers in Latin America and the agricultural cooperatives that 
improve their relationships to agricultural value chains.

I use a variety of techniques
-- a household survey, lab-in-the-field experiment, 
administrative data, and geospatial data --
to answer questions about which producers join cooperatives,
how cooperatives improve their livelihood, and what happens when cooperative
relationships break down.

Another area of [my research](research.html) examines what happens
when smallholder producers exit agriculture: the effect of
government subsidies on internal migration and the role
of worker referrals in the transition to the formal sector. 

As a Jesuit priest-economist, I have recently been featured in Jesuit publications:

* [Jesuit Special Studies: Charting Paths of Learned Ministry](https://www.jesuitscentralsouthern.org/stories/jesuit-special-studies-charting-paths-of-learned-ministry/). 3/4/2025
* [Catholic Social Teaching and Trump's Tariffs](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/03/03/trump-tariffs-catholic-social-teaching-250048). 3/3/2025
