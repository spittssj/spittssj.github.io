# Welcome

Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in the 
[Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the
[University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu). My advisor is
[Marc Bellemare](http://marcfbellemare.com/). My fields
are labor economics and agricultural development and I have a PhD 
minor in GIScience.

I am attending the [AAEA 2023 Annual Meeting](https://www.aaea.org/meetings/2023-aaea-annual-meeting)
where I am presenting two posters based on [fieldwork](fieldwork.html) in Chiapas, Mexico
with colleagues [Chris Boyd](https://www.chrismboyd.com/) and [Grant Storer](https://grantxstorer.com). 

* [Side-Selling: Experimental Evidence from Mexico](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/335981?ln=en) 
*  [Can honey production serve as a coping strategy for coffee producers? Evidence from Mexico](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/335983?ln=en)

Drafts of both papers are available in the [Work In Progress](workinprogress.html) section.
