# Welcome

Welcome to my website. I am the Wade Jesuit Visiting Assistant
Professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.marquette.edu/business/economics/)
of [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu). 

One area of [my research](research.html) examines smallholder 
producers in Latin America and the agricultural cooperatives that 
improve their relationships to agricultural value chains.

I use a variety of techniques
-- a household survey, lab-in-the-field experiment, 
administrative data, and geospatial data --
to answer questions about which producers join cooperatives,
how cooperatives improve their livelihood, and what happens when cooperative
relationships break down.

Another area of [my research](research.html) examines what happens
when smallholder producers exit agriculture: the effect of
government subsidies on internal migration and the role
of worker referrals in the transition to the formal sector. 

I hold a PhD in Applied Economics from the University of Minnesota
and an MS in International and Development Economics from the University of 
San Francisco.

My job market paper [Unpacking Side-Selling: Experimental Evidence from Mexico](http://doi.org/10.1111/agec.70051) was recently published in *Agricultural Economics*. 

As a Jesuit priest-economist, I have recently been featured in Jesuit and Catholic publications:

* [Economists express concern about the poor as Supreme Court weighs tariffs](www.osvnews.com/economists-express-concern-about-the-poor-as-supreme-court-weighs-trumps-tariffs/)
* [The ICE raid on a Hyundai plant shows how hard it would be to quit globalization](https://www.americamagazine.org/short-take/2025/09/17/ice-raid-hyundai-plant-korean-globalization/). 9/18/25. [ungated version](pdf/PittsShortTakeHyundaiRaid.pdf).
* [Jesuit Special Studies: Charting Paths of Learned Ministry](https://www.jesuitscentralsouthern.org/stories/jesuit-special-studies-charting-paths-of-learned-ministry/). 3/4/2025
* [Catholic Social Teaching and Trump's Tariffs](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/03/03/trump-tariffs-catholic-social-teaching-250048). 3/3/2025. [ungated version](pdf/PittsInterviewTrumpTariffs.pdf).

Also, a book review of mine of [Research Ethics in Applied Economics](https://www.routledge.com/Research-Ethics-in-Applied-Economics-A-Practical-Guide/Josephson-Michler/p/book/9780367457419) was just published in [Faith & Economics 83](https://christianeconomists.org/faith-economics/articles/).
You can read an [ungated version](pdf/PittsAppliedEconReview.pdf).

Finally, this spring I'll be at the following meetings:

* [CSAE 2026](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/csae-conference-2026) in Oxford, 
presenting "Information Decay and Cooperative Entry Under Risk"
* SOLE sessions of the [MEA](https://mea.sites.grinnell.edu/annual-meetings/)
in Chicago, presenting "The Role of Social Networks in Post-Displacement Outcomes"
