# Welcome

Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in the 
[Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the
[University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu). My advisor is
[Marc Bellemare](http://marcfbellemare.com/). 

Beginning in Fall 2025, I will be the Wade Jesuit Visiting Assistant
Professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.marquette.edu/business/economics/)
of [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu). 

One area of my research examines smallholder agricultural
producers in Latin America and the agricultural cooperatives that 
improve their relationships to agricultural value chains.

In several projects, I have used a variety of techniques
-- a household survey, lab-in-the-field experiment, 
administrative data, and geospatial data --
to answer questions what which producers join cooperatives,
how cooperatives improve their livelihood, and when cooperative
relationships break down.

Another area of my research examines what happens
when smallholder producers exit agriculture: the effect of
government subsidies on internal migration and the role
of worker referrals in the transition to the formal sector. 

As a Jesuit priest, I have recently been featured in Jesuit publications:
* [Catholic Social Teaching and Trump's Tarrifs][[https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/03/03/trump-tariffs-catholic-social-teaching-250048]]
* [Jesuit Special Studies: Charting Paths of Learned Ministry]
(https://www.jesuitscentralsouthern.org/stories/jesuit-special-studies-charting-paths-of-learned-ministry/)
