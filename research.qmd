My work is based on almost twenty years of experience working
with Latin Americans: in the US, on the US/Mexico border, in southern Mexico,
and in northern Peru. The work on agricultural value chains is based
mainly on [fieldwork](fieldwork.html) in Chiapas. The work on structural transformation
is based on harmonized data from the Mexico census that I obtained from [IPUMS](https://international.ipums.org/international/)
and confidental employer-employee data from the [EconLab](https://www.banxico.org.mx/EconLab/inicio)
at the Bank of Mexico. The work on Catholic Social Teaching has come from reflecting
on my work as an economist in light of my own faith tradition. 

Here is my [research statement](pdf/pittsresearchstatement.pdf).
