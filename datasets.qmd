From 2017-18, I conducted household surveys in the seven municipality
region in northeast Chiapas where the indigenous Tseltal people live. 
I used these surveys in my 
[USF master's thesis](https://repository.usfca.edu/thes/1079/). 

I am working on producing summary maps and uploading these surveys
to the Harvard Dataverse. Please contact me for more information.

In summer 2023, we conducted followup survey-experiments in the same
region. Please contact me for more information.
