title: "Data Sets"

From 2017-18, I conducted household surveys in the seven municipality
region in northeast Chiapas where the indigenous Tseltal people live. 
I used these surveys in my 
[USF master's thesis](https://repository.usfca.edu/thes/1079/). 
For Advanced Geocomputing at the University of Minnesota,
I build a [Shiny visualization](https://batsilmaya.shinyapps.io/eftbrowser/) 
of summary statistics from the
survey data. I continue to be interested in how to share
research results with local communities.
