## Tijuana
As a Jesuit novice, in spring 2008, I worked at the [Casa de los Pobres](https://casadelospobresusa.com/)
in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. There I began to learn Spanish as I served food to migrants
every day and listened to their stories.

### El Paso

From 2018-2020, I was the Director of Religious Formation at [Sacred Heart Church](https://www.sacredheartelpaso.org/),
which is four blocks from the US/Mexico border. A [recent article](https://texashighways.com/culture/the-church-at-the-heart-of-el-pasos-segundo-barrio/) gives
more background about the Segundo Barrio Neighborhood.

## Chiapas
Since 2017, I have worked with the [Capeltic](http://www.capeltic.org) 
coffee cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted two rounds of surveys
described in [Datasets](datasets.html).

Here are some 
[Chiapas Fieldwork Photos](chiapas_fieldwork_photos.html) from
the fieldwork we did in 2022. 

Over the years, various people have written articles about my 
relationship with Capeltic. 

* [American Magazine article about Capeltic - May 2019](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2019/03/29/whats-your-cup-coffee-capeltic-chiapas-based-cooperative-serving)
* [Initial story about visiting the coffee plant - July 2019](https://www.jesuitscentralsouthern.org/stories/capeltic-coffee-collaborative-turning-coffee-into-hope/)
* [Recent visit to coffee plant - January 2024](https://ignatiansolidarity.net/blog/2024/03/06/coffee-catholic-social-teaching-delegation-visits-jesuit-supported-coffee-cooperative-in-mexico/)

In addition, from 2018-2020, I worked as the Director of Religious Formation
at [Sacred Heart Church](https://www.sacredheartelpaso.org/) in El Paso, TX,
four blocks from the US/Mexico border. Here I got the idea for my second year paper.
I hope to put up more information from this section soon.
