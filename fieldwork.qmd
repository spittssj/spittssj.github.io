title: "Fieldwork"

I hope to add pictures and richer description here soon.

Since 2017, I have worked with the [Capeltic](http://www.capeltic.org) 
coffee cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted two rounds of surveys
described in [Datasets](datasets.html). 

In addition, from 2018-2020, I worked as the Director of Religious Formation
at [Sacred Heart Church](https://www.sacredheartelpaso.org/) in El Paso, TX,
four blocks from the US/Mexico border. Here I got the idea for my second year paper.
