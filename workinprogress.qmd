Here are three papers that I am working on. Two are based
on [fieldwork](fieldwork.html) in Chiapas with
[Chris Boyd](https://www.chrismboyd.com/) and Grant Storer supported by the
[Center for International Food and Agriculture Policy](https://experts.umn.edu/en/organisations/center-for-international-food-and-agricultural-policy)
at the University of Minnesota. The third is my Second Year Paper. 
Here is my [research statement](pdf/pittsresearchstatement.pdf).

## Unpacking Side-Selling: Experimental Evidence from Rural Mexico

### Abstract
With the rise of market-led development, marketing cooperatives have emerged that offer
smallholder producers a guaranteed minimum price for their cash crops. Their existence is
threatened when members side-sell a part of their harvest to outside buyers. We conduct a
lab-in-the-field experiment with indigenous coffee producers in southern Mexico to examine the
effect of four factors in the marketing decision: additional income, the presence of microcredit
and/or technical assistance, average outside buyer price, and harvest quantity. Our results show
that participants allocate on average 82% of their harvest to the certain-price buyer. Changes
in harvest quantity and outside-buyer price have minimal effects. The offer of complementary
services has a null effect. Moreover, 21% of the participants always allocate their entire harvest
to the certain-price buyer. Extra income increases this probability by 11%. Subgroup analysis
reveals that this effect is limited to existing cooperative members.

## Sweet and Timely Insurance: The Role of Honey in Reducing Coffee Producer Food Insecurity Exposure in Mexico
Grant X. Storer, Stephen Pitts, Chris M. Boyd, Jesse Anttila-Hughes   
Under review.

### Abstract
Smallholder coffee producers face a combination of pre- and post-harvest risk factors that leaves them particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. A popular form of on-farm diversification is honey production through beekeeping, that has both nutritional and commercial value. This study investigates the role of honey production as means of food security management due to the heightened pollinating activity during the coffee flowering stage that follows the annual coffee harvest provides an additional non-contemporaneous source of income. Using primary data collected in coffee-producing regions of Chiapas, Mexico, I find that during the honey harvest months, which occurs during the early stage of the lean season, beekeeping coffee producers are less exposed to food insecurity over coffee producers who don’t diversify into honey.

## Where You Go Depends on Who You Know: Social Networks as Determinants of Mexican Internal Migration
Stephen Pitts   
6 Sep 2022

### Abstract
Recent qualitative evidence suggests that social networks play
an important role in potential migrants’ decisions to migrate and their choice
of destination. Yet even the latest literature employing microeconomics migration
models with social networks often only estimates these models on
small household panel data sets. In this paper, I use the Mexican population
census to estimate a structural gravity model with social networks on internal
migration flows from origin municipalities to destination states over three
recent five-year periods at the intensive and extensive margin. To proxy for
the social networks, I use internal migrant flows along the same corridor in a
previous time period. My results show that social networks affect migration
flows. At the extensive margin, a 1% increase in the size of the social network
increases by 5%, 12%, and 13% the likelihood of a migration corridor; at the
intensive margin, the equivalent social network elasticities are 19%, 30%,
and 32%. I identify the effects using origin and destination characteristics
as well as the presence of a migrant flow in 1960 to control for other factors
that could drive migration along these corridors. These results contribute
to both microeconomic and macroeconomic analysis of the determinants of
migration.
